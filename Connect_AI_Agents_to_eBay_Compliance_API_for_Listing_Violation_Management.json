Only one compliance type can be passed in per call, and the response will include all the listing violations for this compliance type, and listing violations are grouped together by eBay listing ID.

Note: A maximum of 2000 listing violations will be returned in a result set. If the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, some/all of those listing violations must be corrected before additional listing violations will be retrieved. The user should pay attention to the total value in the response. If this value is '2000', it is possible that the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, but this field maxes out at 2000. Note: In a future release of this API, the seller will be able to pass in a specific eBay listing ID as a query parameter to see if this specific listing has any violations. Note: Only mocked non-compliant listing data will be returned for this call in the Sandbox environment, and not specific to the seller. However, the user can still use this mock data to experiment with the compliance type filters and pagination control.\n\nParameters:\n- Query parameters:\n  ‚Ä¢ compliance_type (optional) - A seller uses this query parameter to retrieve listing violations of a specific compliance type.
