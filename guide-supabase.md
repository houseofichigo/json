### Create the `plans` table

The plans table should have 4 fields in total

1. `id` (int8) primary, just use the default settings
2. `period_type` (text) - we are using this field to index the different periods, the possible values are: `quarter` `month` and `week`
3. `period_index` (text) - this will store the value of the `period_type` - for example `2025-Q2` for the second quarter of 2025
4. `plan_value` (text) - the actual value of the plan for the given period

### Create the `posts` table

Name your bucket `instagram-images` or anything that fits the naming criteria - but remember the name as you'll need to set it in n8n.
